    <h2> OUR HISTORY</h2>
     <p>Our story dates back to the late "90s when our able founder directors MR & MRS Wanyonyi came up with the idea of starting a school in Nambale.</p> 
     <p>In the early 2000 the dream came true when the school was build from sweat and scratch.With the ECD section and six upper classes the small school had a passion to conquer and it had shown it was here to stay.</p>
     <h2>CURRENTLY</h2>
